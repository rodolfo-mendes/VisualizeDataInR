title: "How to change the numbers of bins in a histogram"

In the post [How to build a histogram in R]() we learned that, based on our
data, the **hist()** function automatically calculates the size of each bin of
the histogram. However we may find the default number of bins does not offer
sufficient details of our distribution. Or we may want to summarize the details
of the distribution by grouping one or more range values. So in order to perform
this adequation we can change the number of the bins to better satisfy our
needs.

So let's start with a simple histogram of the Petal.Length attribute of the iris 
dataset:

```{r}
hist(iris$Petal.Length, col = 'skyblue3')
```

Observe that we have a very unbalanced distribution, including an empty bin in
range [2,2.5]. Maybe if we group these intervals we could get a better
visualization.
