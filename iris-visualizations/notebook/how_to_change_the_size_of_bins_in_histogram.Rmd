In the post [How to build a histogram in R]() we learned that, based on our
data, the **hist()** function automatically calculates the size of each bin of
the histogram. However we may find the default bin size does not offer
sufficient details of our distribution. Or we may want to summarize the details
of the distribution by grouping one or more range values. So in order to perform
this adequation we can change the size of the bins to better satisfy our needs. 


```{r}
plot(cars)
```
