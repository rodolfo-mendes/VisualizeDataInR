title: "How to add labels to a histogram"

In previous posts we learned how to build a basic histogram, using the default
plot settings of R and then we learned how to add colors to the bars of our
histogram. Let's quickly review these steps, so you don't have to read theses 
posts by now. In order to build a simple histogram all we have to do is to call
the **hist()** function passing our data as argument. If we want to add some
color to the histogram color we must pass a color name (or RGB
hexadecimal code) as argument to the **col** parameter:

```{R}
hist(iris$Sepal.Length, col = '#BBDEFB')
```

By observing the produced histogram we conclude that about 30 instances have
the Sepal Length attribute between 6 and 6.5. We also conclude that the ranges
[4,4.5), [7,7.5) and [7.5,8) have about 5 instances of data each. However these
conclusions are approximations, and we would like to know the exact number of 
instances for each range without the help of an auxiliar table.

The solution to this problem is simply add labels to each bar of the histogram. 
This is easily obtained by passing a TRUE value as argument to the **labels**
parameter of the **hist()** function:

```{R}
hist(iris$Sepal.Length, col = '#BBDEFB', labels = TRUE, ylim=c(0,35))
```

Now on top of each bar there is a label indicating the exact number of instances
of each range of the attribute Sepal Length. We observe that between 6 and 6.5 
we have 31 instances in fact, while the ranges [4,4.5), [7,7.5) and [7.5,8) have 
5,6 and 6 instances respectively.
