title: "How to scale a histogram"
output: html_notebook
---

Hi again! We already have learned how to build a simple histogram, add colors
to it and how to customize its labels. In the case you haven't learned yet, just 
follow the links [How to build a histogram in R][1],
[How to add colors to the histogram][2] and
[How to add labels to the histogram][3].

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by
pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be
saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to
preview the HTML file).
